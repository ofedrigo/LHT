Likelihood Heterogeneity Test (LHT):
Huelsenbeck, J. P., and J. J. Bull. 1996. A likelihood ratio test to detect conflicting phylogenetic signal. Syst. Biol. 45:92-98.
Basically, this method compares the likelihood considering the datasets independently versus concatenating the datasets. This is a very important issue in the genomic era. Indeed, model mis-specification can be a source of misleading signal in phylogenetic reconstruction, it is therefore important than if the data is concatenated that all the partitions of the dataset share the same assumptions and parameters.
I have used this method in one of my latest work in collaboration with Dr. Vicente Faria on a Pristidae phylogeny based on multiple genes, in order to test if the datasets were combinable.
